# SourceryText
A video game with text-based graphics!


DESCRIPTION

The world of SourceryText is filled with whimsical oddities and powerful magic, but it hasn't always been that way.

Ever since a handful of months ago, SourceryText was a simple place. Only 4 text characters existed: the ' ', the '#', the '*', and the '@.' And that was enough to describe everything, people, places, and things all existed and did not require any nuance to describe. If it was a '#', you couldn't walk through.

Times were simple, but one day, some unknown person decided to descend down The Source Pit, a gaping hole deep enough to have no bottom - it literally exited out of the universe and into its source code. That guy wrote a new patch that allowed for more characters, color, and variety. The universe reconfigured itself, and the world was forever changed.

When the changes hit, you (the player) fell unconscious, waking up months after. Being stuck in a coma in the mountain ranges made you a perfect snack for the local wolves, but luckily a kind man by the name of Dennis carried you to his house to recover. In thanks for saving your life, Dennis tasks you with traveling to the Source Pit and undo the change the unknown person did months ago...


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Computer must be more powerful than a potato. Toasters will probably work, so that's good. If you unfortunately have only a potato, we suggest putting the potato in the toaster to boost its power.
Be sure to hook up the coffee machine to the toaster, to ensure compatibility with Java. 8 beans minimum capacity for the coffee machine, though.


FOR THOSE CONCERNED WITH EDITING THE SOURCE CODE (OF THE GAME, NOT IN THE GAME)

Running GameStart out of the IDE will be meet with failure.
The game is built to be exported as a .jar before being ran.
