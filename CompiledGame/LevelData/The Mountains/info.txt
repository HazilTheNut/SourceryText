Story:

Many, many years ago -- longer than anyone can remember -- a kingdom stood mighty and strong, using the mountains themselves to tower over their enemies.
The Mountains proved itself as a powerful military and defensive asset, but it was also the kingdom's key weakness.
Over the course of several harsh winters, the people were forced to evacuate or face the yearly famine. The whole kingdom picked itself up and walked down the mountain, resulting in the creation of The City.
There are still a few thick-skinned individuals who decided to remain, and they gave way to the descendants who would reclaim the mountains: The Bandits.

Nowadays, The Bandits rule the mountains with no plans of leaving. Instead of growing their own food, they just steal from the neighboring villages at the foot of the mountain.
No more fussing about any famines if making the food isn't your business.

The ancient kingdom knew of what power The Source could bring to any person, if they dared to descend to the bottom. An airtight guard of The Source prevented anyone from messing with the universe in highly-consequential ways.
However, with them gone, The Source remains unguarded, aside from a gate whose lock can only be opened with a select few keys still lost into the depths of the world.
In a way, their legacy lives on to this very day.
