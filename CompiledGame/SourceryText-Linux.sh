# Run the main game
# There are individual files for this so people don't have to be afraid of the command line
#
# This game was built on Java 11, so please use at least that version for running.  You can install java at
#  https://jdk.java.net/11/
# If you have multiple java versions on your system, you can change `java` to be the absolute path to the correct
#  installed version, for example `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java`
