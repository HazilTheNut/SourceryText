    /**
     * Tag:
     *
     * The Backdrop, Tiles, Entities, Warp Zones, and Level Scripts are all essential to the Sourcery Text Level,
     * but without doubt the Tag is the central foundation of Sourcery Text game itself.
     *
     * The Tag, and its child classes, governs and adds formality to the interactions between Entities, Tiles, Items, Projectiles, and Explosions.
     *
     * Tags are powerful, partly because they are transferable. For example, the OnFireTag can be added to any TagHolder and still work properly.
     * So that means very general rules can be created with very easily. For example, the OnFireTag has a rule where if two TagHolders contact each other, fire will spread to the other.
     *
     * These generalities encourage developing universal rules, and thus a sense of world simulation.
     *
     * Coupled with this is the Tag's modularity.
     *
     * Each Tag can be viewed as a singular "behavior" being added to a TagHolder. Any combination of Tags can be added to a TagHolder.
     * This has some great benefits. For example, the ItemRegistry leverages this property to create a registry of Items that can be wildly different from each other.
     * Additionally, this makes describing the properties of any TagHolder very easy to do, as you can just form a list of the Tags is has and get a good description of how it works.
