     * TagEvent:
     *
     * A structured approach to handling the effects of Tags compounding on top of each other.
     *
     * It has the following features:
     *  > amount             : An adjustable number throughout the event. Be careful with multiplicative types of operations, considering that Tags can be called upon in any order
     *  > success            : An adjustable boolean throughout the event. Events that are not successful will prevent that action. (Although there are special cases)
     *  > cancel             : The entire event can be canceled, overriding the 'success' feature, and it cannot be undone.
     *  > target and source  : The cause of the event and the receiving end are both known to all the Tags
     *  > cancelable actions : Some actions can be set to only run if the event is successful and is not canceled.
     *  > future actions     : Some actions can be set to only run after all Tags are parsed. For example, adding and removing Tags will cause ConcurrentModificationExceptions if they are done in the future.
     *  > gi (GameInstance)  : In most cases, the GameInstance is known.
